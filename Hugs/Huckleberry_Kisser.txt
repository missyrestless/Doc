// HOW TO USE YOUR PLAY MENU
// ============================================================
Thank you for purchasing the Huckleberry Play Menu!!
This notecard explains everything you need to know.
When wearing this object, others can click on your face to access the menu.
// ------------------------------------------------------------

SET YOUR NAME (so it says "John's nose" instead of "Avatar's nose")
// ------------------------------------------------------------
From the Settings menu, Click Name.  When the text box appears, type your name and hit Submit.
Examples:
• John
• Princess Luna
• Big Bad Wolf
→ Your name is now saved!
Select Clear name from the Settings Menu to use your resident name.
// ------------------------------------------------------------
RESET (when you change whitelist, or blacklist)
// ------------------------------------------------------------
Any time you edit the Whitelist notecard, or the Blacklist notecard:
• Select Reset from the Settings Menu
This reloads everything instantly.
// ------------------------------------------------------------
WHITELIST – WHO CAN USE THIS OBJECT
// ------------------------------------------------------------
By default: Everyone can touch and use it.
To restrict access to specific people:
While Wearing the Play Menu, Right-click the worn object from your inventory → Edit → Content tab
Find and open the notecard named: Whitelist
(must be spelled exactly like that, case-sensitive)
Edit the notecard and write one full legacy name per line:
• Use legacy names (Firstname Lastname)
• "Resident" is added automatically if someone has a single name
• Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored
Save the notecard
Select Reset from the Settings Menu
→ Now only the people in the list + YOU (the owner) can open the menu.
Everyone else gets the message: "You are not on the whitelist."
To make it public again:
• Delete all names from the Whitelist notecard
• Select Reset from the Settings Menu → back to public!
// ------------------------------------------------------------
BLACKLIST – WHO CANNOT USE THIS OBJECT
// ------------------------------------------------------------
By default: No one is blacklisted.
To block specific people from accessing the menu (overrides whitelist and public access):
While Wearing the Play Menu, Right-click the worn object from your inventory → Edit → Content tab
Find and open the notecard named: Blacklist
(must be spelled exactly like that, case-sensitive)
Edit the notecard and write one full legacy name per line:
• Use legacy names (Firstname Lastname)
• "Resident" is added automatically if someone has a single name
• Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored
Save the notecard
Select Reset from the Settings Menu
→ Now the people in the list are blocked from opening the menu (no message is sent to them).
To remove blocks:
• Delete names from the Blacklist notecard
• Select Reset from the Settings Menu
// ------------------------------------------------------------
QUICK TIPS
// ------------------------------------------------------------
• Worn on Mouth - Touch the mouth area to emote (Only Owner can access settings)
• Owner is always allowed, even without being in the whitelist or if on the blacklist
• Display name vs legacy name: the script uses legacy name (John Doe), not display name (☆★John★☆) for the one who touches
• Blacklist takes priority: If someone is on both lists, they are blocked
// ------------------------------------------------------------
Enjoy the kisses, boops, and noms!
If something doesn’t work, just reset the script – 99% of issues are fixed that way.
Have fun! ♡
