Extra stuff and tips

*Terrain should be non-metallic → keep Metallic (B channel) at or near black.

*Roughness controls shine: lighter = dull dirt, darker = wet/muddy.

*Use subtle normals—strong normals look crunchy at distance.

*Match all four terrain layers for smooth blending between heights.

*Test at different windlight / EEP settings—PBR reacts strongly to lighting.



That’s it. Paint smart, keep it subtle, and let the lighting do the heavy lifting.

HAVE FUN AND STAY AWESOME! ♥
