Rez the:
"Lil' PropJet Plane [Temp Rez] - Regimade" (36 Land Impact)

Wait a second, then sit ...or it will kick you out! lol
You might need to disable your AO to see the seat pose.
Planes are temp rez so they will disappear after 1 min if you don't sit on them.
They will also disappear when you fly them and stand up if it has been 1 min.
