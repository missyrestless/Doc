# AVsitter Sequence for Headhunter Jungle Bar Center Poles

This folder contains an `[AV]sequence_settings` notecard for use with
the `AVsitter2` plugin `[AV]sequence` to provide animation sequences for
the Headhunter Jungle Bar Center Poles dialog menus.

## Menus

An animation sequence is configured for each of the 4 carved wooden poles in the
center of the Jungle Bar. An avatar seated on one of the center poles will have
a dialog menu entry that provides an automated sequence of animations.

## Download the script and customized notecard

Download the `[AV]sequence` plugin script:

```bash
wget -q -O '[AV]sequence' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AVsitter/AVsitter/refs/heads/master/AVsitter2/Plugins/AVsequence/%5BAV%5Dsequence.lsl
```

Download the customized `[AV]sequence_settings` notecard:

```bash
wget -q -O '[AV]sequence_settings' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/missyrestless/Doc/refs/heads/main/AVsitter/Jungle_Bar/Center/AVsequence_settings
```

## Setup

**[NOTE:]**
The Headhunter Jungle Bar Center Poles are 4 linked prims configured with AVsitter. Each animates
a separate sitter. Each of these 4 prims can be configured to provide an animation sequence for
that sitter. To configure all 4, simply repeat this process for each of the linked prims.

To configure a Headhunter Jungle Bar Center Pole with AVsitter sequences:

1. Right click the center poles of the bar and select `Edit`
1. Click the `Edit linked` checkbox
1. Left click on the center pole you wish to configure
1. Copy the `[AV]sequence_settings` notecard into the Contents tab of this linked prim
1. Copy the `[AV]sequence` plugin script into the Contents tab
1. Edit the `AVpos` notecard in the Contents tab
  - Right click on the `AVpos` notecard in the Contents tab
  - Select Open
  - Add the following line to the beginning of the `AVpos` notecard:
    - SEQUENCE Sequence
  - Save the modified `AVpos` notecard
1. If desired, repeat steps 3-6 with the other 3 center poles
  - The same customized `[AV]sequence_settings` can be used for all 4 linked prims
  - The same `[AV]sequence` can be used for all 4 linked prims
  - Add the `SEQUENCE Sequence` line to the beginning of each `AVpos` notecard
1. Close the `Edit` window
1. Right click the center poles and select `More` -> `More` -> `Scripts` -> `Reset Scripts`
1. Wait for the scripts to reset

Sit on one of the center poles. You should see a menu entry `Sequence`. Click this menu entry and your
avatar will cycle through all the animations. Cycle times are currently set to 60 seconds
with menu arrows to step to the next animation, previous animation, or pause animation sequencing.

### Auto Play Sequence

If you wish to automatically play a sequence when an avatar sits on the Jungle Bar center
pole then download the `autoplay.lsl` script and copy it into the Contents of the object.

```bash
wget -q -O 'autoplay' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/missyrestless/Doc/refs/heads/main/AVsitter/Jungle_Bar/autoplay.lsl
```

Drop the `autoplay` script into each of the linked prims you configured above.
When an avatar sits on any of the `autoplay` configured center poles, the
animation sequence for that pole will automatically play.
