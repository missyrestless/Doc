 * * * * * * * * * * * CONFIGURATION NOTECARD  * * * * * * * * * * *
how to find the configuration notecard: 1. edit the tip jar 2.go to content tab 3. open that notecard.
ADVICE: enlarge the notecard, for a better display of the settings.
 you have to know everything on the configuration notecard starts with the symbol >> #
 wont affect the scripts, and are just comments.
 everything else WITHOUT # are the actual settings for example.
many of the options have the symbol >> = so if the line starts like this:
 access = NOTECARD 
 
 that means this is option. the first name must stay as is (this is the explainable option)
 and AFTER the symbol = is the one that you use as option with  SPECIFIC command.
 
 many settings are divided in categories,  and gives you the specific commands you can use on each line.
 lets start!
 
 ----------- SHARE TIPS WITH A PERSON -----------
 setting:
 split with=00000000-000-0000-0000-00000000000=0
 
 this option allows you to share the tips with another person in percentage.
 and works like this: 
                      ↓ ADD THE AVATAR KEY HERE↓                  ↓ PERCENTAGE
split with=00000000-000-0000-0000-00000000000=0

the 2nd part replace it with the avatar key you want to be sharing, 
the 3rd part is the percentage that given on each tip.
so if you set percentage: 10 means the tip jar use will take the 90%, 
and the rest 10% go to that person with av key you added.
