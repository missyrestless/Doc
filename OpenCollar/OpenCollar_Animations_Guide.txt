Open Collar Animations Guide
*******************************
To animate your sub, there are two methods you may use.  
1) Click on the sub's collar to bring up the menu, select "Collar", then "Animations".  Use "Couples" menu option for 
     couples animations, or choose "Pose" for sub single animations.
2) In local chat, type the initials of your sub's name followed immediately by the name of the animation, then hit "enter"
     Example:  Sub's name is jane smith and the animation you want is "bara"
                        type: jsbara
                        
                        Sub's name is jane resident (the default last name for all 
                        newer avs)
                        type: jrbara

    Making your command "silent":  if you type "jsbara" in local chat, anyone 
    within chat range will "hear" your command.  To make the command "silent" or "invisible", simply type 
    /1jsbara
    
    To release your sub from the animation:  type jsrelease in local chat, or /1jsrelease

    For couples poses:  sub or Owner types the command, then the full first name of the recipient
                    type:  jsleghug John
