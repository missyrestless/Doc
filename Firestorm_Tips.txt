Search your inventory with a wildcard using the plus sign:

    larax+dress
    purple+latex+socks

ctrl+alt+p - Toggle movelock so you don't get run over
alt + shift + h  - Toggle showing HUD displays 
alt + shift + u  -  Toggle all menus items and buttons
ctrl + shift + alt + 2  - May reduce lag in very crowded sims (toggles non-avatar alphas)  

In local chat type:
    'flr' to teleport to ground level. 
    tp2 Carrie  (teleport on top of your friend's head. I swear.)

    While in the air, type 'rezplat' in local to rez a platform prim to stand on.
    Type 'gth 2000' to teleport to 2000m
