[SP] EXP Smart Teleporter - Setup Guide
=======================================

The [SP] EXP Smart Teleporter is a versatile tool that adapts to your needs, 
making setup a breeze. This guide will walk you through the process, from basic 
to advanced configurations.

Important: Before setting up, ensure that the Starchild Productions experience 
is enabled on your region or parcel. This allows the script to teleport you and 
your guests smoothly. The experience permission pop-up only needs to be accepted 
the first time.

=======================================
Quick Setup
=======================================

1) Simple One-Way Teleport (Using a Landmark)
---------------------------------------------
1. Drop the script into any prim.
2. Add a landmark to the prim's inventory.

Touch the prim to teleport instantly.

1a) Teleport with Directional Facing (Using a Landmark)
-------------------------------------------------------
1. Drop the script and a notecard named 'destinations' into your prim.
2. Edit the LM_LOOK_AT variable in the notecard. Copy the position of the object 
   you want to face after teleporting and paste it here 
   (e.g., LM_LOOK_AT = <110.220.330>).

Now, when you touch the prim, you'll teleport and face the direction of the object 
specified.

Example: Create a landmark that leads to your front door. Then, grab the object 
position of your door and set it as the LM_LOOK_AT target. This ensures you teleport 
and face your front door.

Note: Our script uses advanced workarounds to ensure this feature works reliably, 
unlike other scripts that might fail due to a longstanding bug in Second Life.

=======================================
Intermediate Setup
=======================================

2) Multi-Destination Teleport
-----------------------------
1. Drop the script into a fresh, empty prim.
2. Add a notecard named 'destinations' with the following structure:

   name1=slurl1
   name2=slurl2

Example:

   Office=http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Crystal%20Island/121/107/3012
   Event=http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Crystal%20Island/131/130/23

A menu will appear when the teleporter is activated, allowing users to choose 
their destination.

Note: A maximum of 50 destinations can be added due to memory limitations.

2a) Multi-Destination with Directional Facing
---------------------------------------------
Follow the steps in section 2 and add optional LOOK_AT vectors after the SLURLs:

   name1=slurl1 <lookat1>
   name2=slurl2 <lookat2>

Example:

   Office=http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Crystal%20Island/121/107/3012 <111,222,33>
   Event=http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Crystal%20Island/131/130/23 <123,123,2000>

Tip: Create a SLURL that lands two meters in front of your tier terminal, then use 
the terminal’s object location as your LOOK_AT target. You’ll now face the terminal 
after teleporting.

=======================================
Extras
=======================================

Using Sounds
------------
- Drop a sound clip into the inventory. It will play automatically before teleporting.
- Note: You may need to configure a delay (see below) to ensure the sound plays before 
  the teleport occurs.

Using Animations
----------------
- Drop an animation into the inventory. It will play automatically before teleporting.
- Note: Configuring a delay (see below) can help the animation play convincingly, 
  such as when walking down a ladder.

=======================================
Advanced Configuration (Destinations Notecard)
=======================================

# ACCESS - Either 'Anyone', 'Group' or 'Owner'
# NOTE: make sure you have a group set on your teleporter object when you want to use group access.

ACCESS                  = Anyone

# ACCESS_DENIED - a custom message to display when the user has no access to use the teleporter. 
# NOTE: the tag [ACCESS] will be replaced by the actual access level set above.

ACCESS_DENIED  = I'm sorry this teleporter is set to be used by [ACCESS] only.

# HOVER_TEXT - A text displayed in hovertext. Like 'Teleport' or 'To the event'...
# Note: clear the value if you wish to clear the hover text. ie: HOVER_TEXT          = 
# Default: Destinations

HOVER_TEXT          = 

# INFO_TEXT - Allows you to remove even the temporary informative text like 'busy' when in use.
# Note: in case you want a completely invisible prim this could help. otherwise not recommended.
# Note: format: 'Yes' or 'No'  Default: Yes

INFO_TEXT               = Yes

# TOUCH - activate on touching the prim.
# Note: In case no animation is present,,the user gets the menu or gets instantly teleported depending on the presence of a LM inside.
# Note: In case there IS an animation present, the user is made to sit on the prim on touch first, 
# then either gets the menu, or gets teleported after sitting, depending the presence of a LM inside.
# Note: format: 'Yes' or 'No'

TOUCH                     = Yes

# TOUCH_TEXT - Short txt displayed on the pie menu when right clicking the prim for touch
# Note: clear the value if you wish to have the default touch text. ie: TOUCH_TEXT          = 

TOUCH_TEXT          = Teleport

# COLLISION - activate on bumping into the prim. great for an invisible prim in a dark tunnel 
# Notes: PHANTOM objects get locked to phantom state by the script to still detect avatars!
# Set Collision to 'No' and save to unlock Phantom, then disable phantom on the object. 
# You can now re-enable collision again to detect avatars bumping the solid object now.
# Note: format: 'Yes' or 'No'  Default: No

COLLISION              = No

# SIT_TEXT - Short txt displayed on the pie menu when right clicking the prim for sit
# Important: SIT ABILITY will *automatically activate* when an animation is present in inventory.
# Note: this feature is unused without an animation present in inventory.
# Note: clear the value if you wish to have the default sit text. ie: SIT_TEXT          = 
# Default value is empty and recommended with touch enabled and touch text set .

SIT_TEXT              = 

# FORCE_SIT - When an *animation is present*, we will force the user to sit on the object on touch
# Note: Useful when the animation makes more sense on some object like a ladder down a wishing well
# Note: in case of a general animation that can be played anywhere like a dance, you can disable.
# Note: this feature is unused without an animation present.
# Note: format: 'Yes' or 'No'
# Default is Yes


# MENU_TEXT - Menu text in the main menu. Default: Choose a destination:
MENU_TEXT       = Choose a destination:

FORCE_SIT           = Yes

# ANIM_OFFSET - a positional offset vector to adjust the animation position.
# Note: this setting is ONLY used when an animation  is present in inventory.
# Default (Fanatik's classic well 'ladder' animation) ANIM_OFFSET         = <0, 0.15, 0.95> 

ANIM_OFFSET         = <0, 0.15, 0.95>

# ANIM_ROTATION - a rotational vector to adjust the animation rotation
# Note: this setting is ONLY used when an animation  is present in inventory.
# Default (Fanatik's classic well 'ladder' animation) ANIM_ROTATION    = <0, 0, 90, 90> 

ANIM_ROTATION    = <0, 0, 90, 90> 

# SOUND_VOL - the volume of any sound played. valid ranges are 0.1 (low) to 1.0 (loudest)
# Note: this is only used when a sound is present in inventory.
# Note: Default: 1.0.

SOUND_VOL               = 1.0

# SOUND_RADIUS - limit sounds to this many meters around the teleporter. 0 means  unlimited.
# Note: this is only changed when a sound is present in inventory.
# Note: when no sound is present in inventory, the prim property radius is restored to unlimited.
# Note: Default unlimited. ie: SOUND_RADIUS        = 0

SOUND_RADIUS        = 0

# DELAY_TIME - the time to force delay before teleporting, even when using LM or the destination is chosen quicker.
# Note: this can be used to give any animation or sound present a decent chance to play. 
# Note: this feature can still be used when no sound or animations are present so turn off if undesired.
# Note: the teleporter nicely substracts any seconds the user spends choosing a destination. 
# Note: Recommended with animation or sound: 4.0
# Default 0.0

DELAY_TIME               = 0.0

# ALLOW_FOLLOW - traveling in pairs or in groups? its a nice to know where the other(s) went.
# Note: Enabling this enables the second person to use the teleporter within 30 seconds to follow the first person easily.
# Note: the destination will be revealed in the info text, and that next user gets a menu asking if they want to follow.
# Note: this does not force the user to follow, they can click no and get their own destinations menu.
# Note: after 30 seconds the teleporter clears and any new users get the normal destinations menu again.
# Available values are 'Yes' and 'No' default: Yes

ALLOW_FOLLOW       = Yes

# LM_LOOK_AT - a positional vector to be facing after teleporting using the single landmark inside.
# Note: this is only used when a landmark is inside, completely overruling the menu/destinations below.

LM_LOOK_AT           =  <83.46187, 137.83514, 2011.13098>

# DEBUG - For the developer to assist with debugging any potential future issues you might find..
# Note: debug will spam lots of extra developer information relevant to the internal functioning of the script. 
# Note: In case the script is acting out the creator may request you to enable this for more developer info. 
# Note: a special code will be given to you in case you're requested to turn this on.

DEBUG                       =

# Want more options? with a bit of scripting knowledge using the included API example script you can do anything you like .
# Want to trigger extra custom messages ? want to start and stop a particle effect ? offer inventory before they go ?
# An open (modifiable) API script is included with the system for scripters  that shows how to use the different events.
# The example script shows how to trigger particles. You could put the script in another *linked* prim to be the source..
# Look for the script called: '[SP] Smart Exp Multi Teleporter API example'
