          This is where things get fun! Physics Mode lets you switch between 
          behavioral styles depending on your situation.
          
          TOP MODE (↑)
          * Flip the switch UP for control during penetration.
          * Use the Physics Intensity Slider to adjust ball swing and shaft twitch.
          * Great when furniture isn't animating your cock — or when you want full control.
          
          BOTTOM MODE (↓)
          * Flip the switch DOWN for a more relaxed or passive style.
          * Still fully adjustable and great for immersion.
          * If your furniture has built-in Obsidian angles or bento animations, you 
            might not need this — but many love that extra bit of mastery.
