AVsitter Sequence for Nerenzo Orgy Towel 
========================================

This folder contains the 'AVpos' and '[AV]sequence_settings' notecards for use with the 'AVsitter2' plugin '[AV]sequence' to provide animation sequences for the Nerenzo Orgy Towel dialog menus.

This 'AVsitter' customization allows greater freedom of personal interaction in the sauna, eliminating the need to navigate dialog menus during moments of intimacy.

IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------------

This product does NOT contain the Nerenzo Orgy Towel. You have to purchase the towel from Nerenzo. This product only contains the notecards and scripts used to provide sequenced animations for the towel. This customization of the Nerenzo Orgy Towel only works with the very adult version available on the Second Life Marketplace at https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/Sex-TowelNerenzo-Orgy-Towel-2-x-MF-MMF-FFM-MFMF-The-P-The-V-aeros-INM-Cum-Clean/24936150

In order to deploy this customization it will be necessary to edit the towel object. Detailed instructions are provided below but if you are not comfortable editing Second Life objects then this may be viewed as an opportunity to learn or as something not for you.

Missy Restless and the Truth & Beauty Lab are not affiliated with Nerenzo products in any way other than as an extremely satisfied customer.

Setup
=====

To configure a Nerenzo Orgy Towel with AVsitter sequences:

- Right click the towel and select 'Edit'

- Drag and drop the '[AV]sequence_settings' notecard into the Contents tab

- Drag and drop the '[AV]sequence' plugin script into the Contents tab

- Replace the 'AVpos' notecard in the Contents tab with the 'AVpos' notecard found in this folder
  - Drag and drop the original `AVpos` notecard from the Contents tab into your inventory as a backup
  - Delete the `AVpos` notecard from the Contents tab (you can ignore and close the Warning window)
  - Drag and drop the new `AVpos` notecard with sequences into the Contents tab

- Close the 'Edit' window

- Right click the towel and select 'More' -> 'More' -> 'Scripts' -> 'Reset Scripts'

- Wait for the scripts to reset (this takes a few minutes)

Sit on the towel, select one of the first two sitters (Male1 or Female1). The main menu has buttons for solo and cuddle animation sequences. Click the 'ADULT MF' button then any of the configured adult submenu buttons to view the adult sequenced animations.

Menu entries of the form 'SEQ-...' indicate sequenced animations. Clicking any of these menu entries will cycle seated avatars through all the animations in that submenu. Cycle times are currently set to 60 seconds with menu arrows to step to the next animation, previous animation, or pause animation sequencing.

Auto Play Sequence
==================

If you wish to automatically play a sequence when an avatar sits on the towel then drag & drop the 'autoplay' script into the Contents of the object.

The 'autoplay' script detects the gender of the sitter and plays the appropriate sequence. In addition, it detects the number of sitters currently on the object and plays the couples animation sequence if more than 1 sitter is seated.
