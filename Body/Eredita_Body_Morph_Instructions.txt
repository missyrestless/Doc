Instructions:
--------------
To use a morph, simply select one in a size of your choice and wear or attach it to your avatar.  Depending on the morphs, their sizes may be labeled with numerical Depth, Height, and Width values:

Regarding Size Values:

•The higher the Height value, the further downward the morph pushes the body part
•The higher the Depth value, the deeper backward the morph will push the body part
•The higher the Width value, the closer towards the avatar centerline the morph will push the body part

A few notes to keep in mind when using morphs:

•Morphs can be worn/attached to any part of your avatar and they will still affect the intended body part.
•You can freely mix & match morphs as long as they are for different parts of the body.
•Only 1 size can be worn at a time for the particular part of the body that the morph is labeled for.
•When changing morph sizes for the same part of the body, first take off the one you are already wearing before attaching the replacement.
•Body physics will still work just fine while wearing morphs.
