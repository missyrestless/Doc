1 - NO SOUND?
________________

If you hear nothing, make sure that Sound is enabled in your viewer. It is enabled by default so, unless you disabled it in purpose, you shouldn't have to worry about this setting. If you want to make sure, go to Preferences > Sound & Media and make sure that "Sound Effects" (or just "Sounds") is not disabled.

2 - ON / OFF
____________

Touch the Power Button to turn on/off the Hud.

3 - MAXIMIZED / MINIMIZED HUD SIZE
________________________________________

If you touch the Double Arrow on the right, the HUD will reduce its size and appear in a minimized version. Then, if you touch the Double Arrow again, it will come back to its maximized size.

Minimized version allow you to switch Heat Level up and down and to turn the hud on/off. For advanced features, you have to use the maximized version of the HUD.

4 - HEAT LEVELS
_________________

On the Hud, you can see 7 colored circles. Each one matches a Heat Level. There are 7 Heat Levels, starting from the softest one (Blue) till the hottest one (Red). Depending on the intensity of the action, you can touch one of these circles, and the sound will play accordingly.

- Blue: Breathing
- Light Blue: Soft Moans
- Green: Medium Moans
- Yellow: Hot Moans
- Orange: Pre Orgasm / Pre Cum
- Pink: Orgasm / Cum
- Red: Orgasm +++ / Cum +++

5 - SUCK, THROAT, GAG and PAINFUL PENETRATION
______________________________________________________

On the left side of the Hud, there are 4 buttons: Suck, Throat, Gag and Painful, that are 4 alternative modes. When you click one of these buttons once, it will play this mode at a low speed. If you click the same button again, it will play at full speed. If you click a third time, the Hud will come back to the normal speed.

6 - WORDS and SAY
____________________

The HUD contains 31 sexy sentences, for different sex situations. By clicking the "Say" button, you can trigger one of these sentences.

The second way to trigger a sexy sentence is to type its number on channel 9. For example, type this in local chat:
/9 7
to trigger the sentence °7.

Furthermore, the HUD has a "Words" checkbox. If you check this box, sexy sentences will be automatically said along the moans.

7 - NOISE
__________

The Noise button allows you to select a background noise. This noise can be the sound of bodies bumping against each other, or the noise of bedsprings, Mattress, Water, etc...

The noise sounds won't be played in lower levels (Blue, Cyan and Green). Indeed, it would make no sense to hear intense sex noise in very soft heat levels. Therefore they are played only in levels Yellow to Red.

8 - VOLUME AND MAX DISTANCE
__________________________________

Use the volume button to reduce or increase the volume.

At the bottom of the HUD there is also a button to let you change the distance at which your moans can be heard by people around. Default value is 20 meters. You can click this button and change the distance. Very useful to not bother your neighbors during sex, or to not be heard by everybody around you!

9 - HELP
_________

At any time, you can touch the Interrogation Mark button: that will display a general Help about how to use the HUD.

10 - MINIMIZED VERSION
__________________________

In the Minimized version, instead of colored circles, you will see 2 arrows: one UP and one DOWN. Touching these arrows makes the HUD switch to heat level UP or DOWN. That way, you can control the intensity of your moans just using these 2 arrows. A heat gauge on the left reminds you what level is currently playing.

11 - WARNING
_______________

Some parcel owners enable Avatar Sounds only for the group members of the parcel. In this case, the HUD can work only if you are a group member of this parcel. In this case, if you are a group member, the HUD will work fine, and all people around will hear you, even if they are not themselves group members.


12 - FACIAL EXPRESSION
----------------------

This update introduces a small but very nice new feature: automatic facial expression triggering with the [Good Moaning] Facial Action HUD (this item is sold separately)

The [Good Moaning] Facial Action HUD is a new compact HUD that allows you to play sexual facial animations such as Moan, Suck, Lick, and more.

For example, when you press the “Suck” button on the Voice HUD, the corresponding Suck facial animation is automatically played with the Facial Action HUD.

You can get the [Good Moaning] Facial Action HUD on the Marketplace:

(there is also a male version)

Or directly in the inworld store: 􀀑

How to use the Voice HUD with the Facial Action HUD?

It’s very simple - just wear both HUDs:
- [Good Moaning] Voice HUD
- [Good Moaning] Facial Action HUD

From now on, selecting a voice mode in the Voice HUD will automatically trigger the matching facial animation in the Facial Action HUD!
