# AVsitter Sequence for DaD Outdoor Jacuzzi Hot Tub

This folder contains the `AVpos` and `[AV]sequence_settings` notecards for use
with the `AVsitter2` plugin `[AV]sequence` to provide animation sequences for
the DaD Outdoor Jacuzzi Hot Tub dialog menus.

## Menus

Sequences are configured for the following menus:

- Male and Female Solo Menus
- Couples cuddles
- Wash Menus
- Three Adult Menus

## Download the script and customized notecards

The DaD Outdoor Jacuzzi Hot Tub already has the `[AV]sequence` script and the
`[AV]sequence_settings` notecard configured. Replace the `[AV]sequence_settings`
and the `AVpos` notecards with those downloaded here.

Download the customized `[AV]sequence_settings` notecard:

```bash
wget -q -O '[AV]sequence_settings' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/missyrestless/Doc/refs/heads/main/AVsitter/Hot_Tub/AVsequence_settings
```

Download the customized `AVpos` notecard:

```bash
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/missyrestless/Doc/refs/heads/main/AVsitter/Hot_Tub/AVpos
```

## Setup

**[NOTE:]** Make sure you have a backup of your tub before modifying just in case.
If you do not already have a copy in your inventory, right click the hot tub and
select `Take` then `Take copy`.

To configure a DaD Outdoor Jacuzzi Hot Tub with customized AVsitter sequences:

- Right click the hot tub and select `Edit`
- Select the Contents tab in the Edit window
- Click the `Edit linked` checkbox
- Using `Ctrl .` (press both the Ctrl key and the Period key) locate the notecards (Link number 6)
- Delete the `[AV]sequence_settings` and `AVpos` notecards
- Copy the `[AV]sequence_settings` notecard into the Contents tab
- Copy the `AVpos` notecard into the Contents tab
- Close the `Edit` window
- Right click the hot tub and select `More` -> `More` -> `Scripts` -> `Reset Scripts`
- Wait for the scripts to reset (this takes a few minutes)

Sit in the hot tub and click one of the main menu entries, e.g. click `Single` then `Females`
or `Adult` then `Start`.

You should see a menu entry of the form `SEQ-...`. Click this menu entry and your
avatar will cycle through all the animations in that submenu. Cycle times are currently
set to 60 seconds with menu arrows to step to the next animation, previous animation,
or pause animation sequencing.
