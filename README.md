# SL Doc

This repository is a catch-all for documentation on a variety of Second Life items.
It is more for me to easily find and read the configuration/setup/usage of all the
things I own in SL.

## Repository Contents

- `Bots` : instructions and info on SL bots
- `Colors` : some frequently used color vectors
  - In LSL colors are defined as `<R, G, B>` vectors where each component (Red, Green, Blue) ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, not 0-255. To use standard RGB (0-255), you divide your values by 255 (e.g., `<67, 67, 67>` becomes `<67/255, 67/255, 67/255>`), and you use functions like `llSetColor()` or `llSetLinkColor()` with these vectors to change object or prim colors.
