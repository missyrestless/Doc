♀ Disclaimer: Female Avatars - Although adjustments to the arms have been made during quality control phase to reduce hands clipping into the body, we aren't able to accommodate all shapes without compromising the natural aesthetics of the arm movements. Therefore, hand/arms clipping into the breast may still occur depending on your shape affected by a combination of several factors: shoulder broadness, breast size, breast buoyance, cleavage separation, and arm length. This particular dance, especially with the vogueing moves, have arm movements that brushes close against the body.
