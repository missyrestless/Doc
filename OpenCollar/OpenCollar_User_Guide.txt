OpenCollar User Guide
*****************************
This User Guide has been copied from the OpenCollar Wiki (http://code.google.com/p/opencollar/wiki/UsersGuide).  I've provided it here for easy reference by my customers.  Please direct questions about OpenCollar Use and scripts to the OpenCollar Chatter Group or the OpenCollar R&D Group.
*****************************

OpenCollar (OC) is a set of scripts for a D/s collar similar to other scripted collars in Second Life.

Unlike the other collars, however, OpenCollar is open source.

You are free to copy and redistribute the OC scripts, provided that you leave them full perms.
Read the entire OpenCollar License in the notecard accompanying the scripts.
The OpenCollar architecture is plugin-based, allowing for new features to be added in the future.

Features not found in other collars include:

menu-driven support for the Restrained Love Viewer (formerly Restrained Life Viewer), usually referred to as RLV
ability to automatically punish a sub for saying any word from a list you specify
optional group control, in addition to control by owners and secondary owners (secowners)
menu-driven color and texture settings
automatic updates
online database settings that survive script resets and are automatically transferred if/when the collar is updated
best of all, free open-source code!
Please report any bugs you find or feature requests to the OpenCollar bug tracker at http://code.google.com/p/OpenCollar/issues.

Important

OpenCollar automatically sets the command prefix to the wearer's initials. Enter the wearer's initials before all the commands below. For example, if Greta Grumpsalot were wearing the collar, she would prefix all commands with her initials "gg", typing for example "ggnadu" rather than simply "nadu". Use the prefix command (section 4.0, below) to change the prefix if one other than the default initials is desired.

To give a command to two or more subs at once, use * in place of the usual prefix. For example, *kiss makes all the subs near you in whom you have some degree of ownership (as owner, secowner or member of owning group) give you a kiss. The additional prefix # is for subs who also own other subs: commands prefixed by # will work on the collars of all subs in your neighborhood in whom you have rights directly or indirectly, but not on your own collar.

1.0 Menu collar commands
Notes

The command prefix is explained above. When typing the prefix, do not include the brackets shown in the commands listed below.
When using the chat commands, there is no space between the prefix and the command. See further examples below.

Typing /1 with a space before the prefix and command will cause the command not to appear in local chat; for example, /1 ggkneel will cause Greta Grumpsalot to kneel, but no one other than the person typing the command will see it.

8.0 - Restrained Love Viewer
Notes

Visit http://www.erestraint.com/realrestraint/ to get the correct version of the Restrained Love Viewer (RLV) for your operating system. It is not now necessary to use the RLV viewer itself, as RLV functions are currently supported for example by the Emerald Viewer though not by the standard Linden viewer.

These notes will help you with RLV setup and installation for Windows Vista, but the process is similar for the other platforms.

To use RLV features, the wearer of the collar must be using RLV, and its features must be enabled. Following initial installation this will normally occur on login into SL, but may not if the wearer logs on in a script-free or heavily lagged zone.

If the collar did not manage to realize that the RLV is running on log-in, then you will find a button in the RLV menu called *Turn On*. Press this one to activate the RLV features. You will receive a message if the collar was able to find the RLV or not. If the collar found the appropriate client, the main RLV menu will be available from now on.

If the collar did manage to find RLV on login, you will have immediate access to the main RLV menu.

8.1 - RLV chat commands
Note

For list of main RLV menu commands see section 1.2.8 above.

<prefix>rlvnotify on -- makes the collar notify you each of each restriction applied.

<prefix>rlvnotify off -- turns off notification of restrictions

8.2 Exceptions menu
The RLV exceptions menu is accessed via the main RLV menu. Via this menu an owner accessing a sub's menu may set separate restriction permissions for him- or herself (owner), secondary owners (secowners), or other designated persons (other). Use the add button to place a new person in the vicinity on this list. "Enforce" means that the owner, secowner, or other designated person may enforce the restriction on the sub, while "Exempt" means that he or she may not.

The specific restriction settings are:

IM - can't send IMs

RcvIM - can't receive IMs

RcvChat - can't receive chat

RcvEmote - can't receive emotes

Lure - can't be teleported by friend

RefuseTP - can't refuse TP offer

Exempt All - owner, secowner or other person can enforce no restriction

list - lists enforced/exempted restrictions

defaults - restores the default exemptions

Others: Names will show up from adding them under "add" this is the menu to which you can exempt or restrict them without giving them control over the sub. Lets say special privileges for non-Owners. The only button that is not there from this menu is the list button cause of course those people will appear in menu form when clicking other.

Remove your collar and then rez your collar near to the updater.
Click on the collar or enter the menu command in chat; in the main menu open Help/Debug, and in the submenu Update (not Get Update).
Wait for the updater to update your collar, and then take the collar back into your inventory. You will then have more than one collar of that type, so you can delete the old version.

14 - Timer
The purpose of the timer for the Open Collar collars is to allow a timed release feature for several functions of the collar. The timer can do up to 3 different things when it goes off: 1. Unlock the collar. 2. Unleash the sub wearing the collar 3. Clear all RLV restrictions.

Any or all of the 3 functions can be done with the same timer, for example, unleashing and RLV release can be done together.

The timers can use RL time, or SL time, or a combination of both. RL is real time that continues to run even if logged off. SL time only runs while the sub is online. Note that both timers can be used together, so for example, you can lock a sub for 2 hours SL, or 12 hours RL, which ever comes first.

There are three ways to use the timer: self bondage, Owner controlled bondage and bondage controlled by either secondary-owner, group owned, or open access.

1. Self bondage is where the collar wearer is the owner and sets the timer for themselves. The timer can unlock the collar, unleash the collar, and/or clear all the RLV setting. Once the timer is started, the wearer can not get into the collar menu, until it expires! Examples of usage would include: A. The sub leashes themselves to something, then sets the timer. They are stuck until the timer expires. B. The sub sits on a toy, or somewhere and sets forbid stand, then set the timer to get freed. Again, they are stuck.

2. Owner controlled bondage. This where the owner locks the sub in some manner, then set the timer to free the sub later. The timer can unlock the collar, unleash the collar, and/or clear all the RLV settings. Once the timer is started, the wearer can not get into the collar menu, until it expires! Examples of usage would include: A. owner locks the collar and sets the RL timer so that it unlocks and the collar is unlocked for the weekend. B. The owner leashes the sub someplace, then sets the timer. the sub is stuck until the timer expires. C. The sub is forced to sit on a toy or somewhere and the owner sets forbid stand, then sets the timer to free the sub later. Again, they are stuck.

3. Secondary-owner, group owned, or open access bondage. This where the Top locks the sub in some manner, then sets the timer to free the sub later. The timer can unleash the collar and/or clear all the RLV settings. Once the timer is started, the wearer can not get into the collar menu, until it expires! It does not matter if there is a primary owner or not, in this mode. Examples of useage would include: A. The Top leashes the sub someplace, then sets the timer. the sub is stuck until the timer expires. B. The sub is forced to sit on a toy, or somewhere and the Top sets forbid stand, then sets the timer to free the sub later. Again, they are stuck.

To set a timer, go into the collar menu, press AddOns button, then Timer button. Next to the following: 1. Choose which item/items you wish do: ()unlock, ()unleash. and/or ()clearRLV. 2. Set the time by choosing the reattime or online and setting up a time. 3. Press the start button.

Note: The sub will be locked out of the menu while the timer is running, to keep them from adjusting the timer. Also the sub will NOT be allowed to unlock themselves, if they do not have the access to unock the collar, in other words, the sub can not use the timer to unlock themselves, if the owner locked it. The same applies to unleashing and RLV.
