UNBOXING:
Boxed using the rez2 system.

1. Place rez box on ground or water level and touch the box.

2. Select "Rez" from the menu.  Wait while the entire structure rezzes in a pile and then snaps into position.

3. Move and rotate the rez-box to get perfect position of structure.

4. When you're done, click "FINISH!", which will freeze your build into position.  You may then delete the Rez package.

P.S. you may also derez-the item before selecting "FINISH!" and rezzing again as much as you need (if all parts don't rez as designed if there is some SIM lag or other problems)
