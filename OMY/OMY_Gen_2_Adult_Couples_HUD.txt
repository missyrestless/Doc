MORE INFO:

OMY GEN2 HUDS:

Thank you for reading/purchasing one of our huds. Our huds were designed for people that love PDA and want to show their favorite people in Second Life some love. If this is you...then OMY Huds are FOR YOU!

If you are new to OMY Huds then please take a moment to read some info on how they function and some general info.

------------------------OMY GEN2 HUDS-----------------------

GEN2 HUDS means generation 2. These huds not only animate you but ALSO the avatar you have selected to hud with (target avatar). Our huds not only allow you to just grab on to your target., but also allows you to stand beside them (Left or Right of your choice) and walk with them, meaning your avatar will follow them as they move around which is great for exploring sims, shopping and much more, all while staying close by.

We've allowed for detailed customization of position once you have chosen to animate with your target avatar by including arrows on the hud  (X Y & Z) You can adjust your avatar by clicking theses buttons. Clicking multiple times allow for more detailed adjustments while clicking and holding allows for greater adjustments. Please keep in mind the adjustments are limited. If you find you are not lined up well you can rotate your avatar by simply use your left and right arrow keys on your keyboard or any way you use to turn your avatar regularly. For best hud results that require little adjustments, its recommended that you and your target are both facing the same direction before you activate the hud.

Once you have a perfect position, save it using one of your 5 save position slots. To save simply adjust as needed then click one of the "SAVE" buttons. To play the preset you have saved click "PLAY" under the corresponding saved slot. If at anytime you need to reset to the original position, click "RESET" on the far right of the save and play bar.

If you at any time need to resend your target avatar an animation request and you do not wish to remove the hud. You can do so by clicking the "RESEND ANIMATION" icon (two arrows in a cycle) at the bottom of  the hud. If you want a visual explanation of each button please take a look at the gyazo link at the bottom of this notecard.

Our huds also can be used in sims where you don't have any rez rights. Which means you have almost limitless options on where you can use your hud. Please ensure you do not have movelock activated when using our huds as this will prevent you from animating correctly. Its recommended that you use your huds where you have ample space above your avatar. Low ceilings and or hidden things above you that may not be set to phantom may prevent animating correctly. For example if you find your avatar is being pushed, sliding or in the ground you may be bumping or have movelock on.

It is very important that you be mindful of which hud you are purchasing. All of our huds animations were designed with either male or female body shapes. For example, if you are a female its recommended that you purchase a female hud and vice versa as this will animate your avatar with the frame intended. 

Our animations are very detailed and much time and effort has been put into making them as natural and detailed as allowed. That in mind, if you or your hud partner have a drastically larger or smaller frame than each other or your body shape is extreme for an average body type or proportions, you will find that the hud does not animated you as seen in our ads. All of our huds were designed with average body shapes and heights for both male and female.

Our male and female huds were created with a difference of 1ft difference and our same gender huds were all create with the same height. We offer a FREE body shape in our mainstore (for both male and female) that is modifiable where you can use how you like. Take a look at the shape or use it for yourself. This will allow you to really enjoy all of our creations as intended with the best animation results.
