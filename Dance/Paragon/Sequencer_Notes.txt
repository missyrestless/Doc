Sequencer Settings 􀀁

- Click a set on the top row to edit (you can only save 1 set at a time)
- Make sure to write a name for your set in the input box
- Add dances by the order you want them to play
- Set the duration in seconds. (Refer to product notecard or click on an animation and look at it's description for exact duration). 
- Click save. (Saving only saves the current active set)
- Use side scrolling on the top to choose from Set 1 to Set 20

Max seconds per dance: 9999 (advised less than 60 seconds)
Max dances to sequence: 75
If you add a lot of dances in a set, use your mouse scroll to keep viewing down
Sequencer will remember all sequences even if the HUD is updated

Sequencer Playlist 􀀀
- First, you have to click the 'play' icon and choose a dance, or dance with your partner
- Then, Click "SEQUENCED PLAYLIST' button
- Choose a set you previously saved.
- The sequence will play your saved set ordered dances with the duration in seconds you defined when making the set on webmedia
- The "SEQUENCED PLAYLIST' button also can 'Shuffle' to randomize the set order, or sequence all dances you have inside the HUD
- The navigation panel in the HUD itself allows you to skip previous, play/pause or skip to next dance

Limitations:
- Notecards, animations and Set Names should not have 3 asterisks together '***'
- Special characters in Set Names should be avoided, text-only advised.
- When in Singles mode, couples dances won't play and vice-versa, so keep your sets labeled and filled with the same dance types. I.e.; Set 'Romantic' only contains couple dances
