Lovense Support

MOAP-based Lovense System 3

MOAP is "media on a prim", which lets us put web-based user interfaces on prims in Second Life. We use this
for our advanced Lovense HUD.

NO need for a bridge or relay. Simply click Connect My Toys and scan the QR code with either Lovense Remote
or Lovense Connect.

You get absolute real-time control of every Lovense device and every function.

Pervshield

To turn PervShield on and off, while seated click on the legs or go to Adjust->PervShield. When active, nobody can sit on the furniture with you.

Changing Textures

There are 2 ways to change textures:

1) Click on the rivets on the side of the seats

2) Sit on the chair and go to either the main GUY or GIRL position and click on the Texture menu.

Then, simply click it then pick one of the pre-made textures themes or set the texture on the sofa or each individual pillow. You can also set the access for who can change the textures. You can also CLICK the chair to get a menu to change textures. This can be done if seated or NOT.

Swapping Positions

The furniture comes with easy to use menu called Swaps that allows you to easily swap any user to any other position on the sofa.
