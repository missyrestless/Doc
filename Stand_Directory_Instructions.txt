Stand Directory Teleporter v1.2
░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

Neat and elegant tool that allows you and your visitors teleport to any location in the grid, managed by you.
Simple setup, just a landmark, no notecards or hassles! 

Two sets included, one with Auto Name Rendering models (4, 5, 6 or 8 panels), another texture based DIY models (4, 5, 6 or 8 panels).
The Auto Name Rendering models will render the name of the location automatically in each panel (Up to 16 characters per location).
The DIY models, require you to create a texture with the name of the location to teleport, displayed on each panel.
Also included: 3D words pack to help you customize if needed.

Setup Land Experience
░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

You must own the land where you want to place the teleporter.
If you rent the land, the landlord may be able to assist you by enabling the "experience" required for this teleporter to work as explained below.
Works on land that is set to a group, however, it will need to be setup by the group owner before deeding the board to the group.

For your parcel:
    1) Open the About Land settings, select tab "Experiences".
    2) Under Allowed Experiences, click Add.
    3) Click Choose Experiences, type LunaMare and hit Go.
    4) Select the experience LunaMare Gadgets (by Andred Darwin) and hit OK.

For your region:
    Same steps as for a parcel, but you will do it under "Region/Estate" settings. 

Done, now you can rez your teleporter.

Setup Teleporter
░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

1)  Go the exact place you want your visitors (or yourself) to teleport, create a landmark.
2)  Rename the landmark following this pattern: X ## Location Name, where X is used to determine the location sequence (alphabetically) to be displayed on panels from top to bottom, as for the Location Name you may use any, up to 16 characters.

Example:

1 ## Teleporters
2 ## Spring Up Decor
3 ## Rezzer Machines
4 ## Home & Garden

Basically, the script will parse the name of each landmark and use whatever is left of "##" to determine the sequence of each location on the panel (top to bottom alphabetically), first found, first displayed... and whatever is right of "##" will be displayed as the name of the location up to 16 characters on Auto Name Rendering models.
There is a texture/picture included in the set showing an example of how the contents of the teleporter would look like (Based on the one we use at our main store).

3)  Add the renamed landmarks inside the stand. (Edit, Contents tab).
4)  Click on the stand, and select "Reset" on menu.
5)  If you are using an Auto Name Rendering model, add your logo texture to the respective face. (You may use a mesh as your logo, following the instructions at the end of this notecard)
5b) If you are using the a DIY model, you will need to create a texture with the name of the location on a transparent background (256px x 43px or 512px x 85px) and add it to the respective panel face (Click "Reset" on menu first to display default texture). 

Thats it! 

The board will ask permission to teleport you (and your visitors) just once after clicking on a panel.

The owner menu is presented when clicking on the stand itself.

Its a common practice to rez another stand at the destination (if applicable) so your visitors can return or select another area to visit.
Also a common practice to setup one stand with all locations, then just rez a copy where needed, you may remove the current location landmark from the stand or your visitor would teleport to the same area.

Customization
░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

All models come with mod and copy permissions, you may select a material on menu (Materials) and edit it as you see fit.
I recommend you to not unlink or link any extra prim/mesh to the teleporter, if you really need and want to, here is the required sequence to link it back. (The script will not work if prims/meshes are not linked in the following order and it may "ruin" your custom mesh)

Link order for Auto Rendering model: (from first selection to last selection in-world)
░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░

- Any custom meshes or prims you may are adding to the model (logos, decor, words, etc...)
- Each Auto Name Rendering panel from right to left, bottom to top (2 meshes per panel)
- Word Teleporter mesh (You may use your own as long as it is 1 mesh/prim)
- Word Directory mesh (You may use your own as long as it is 1 mesh/prim)
- Word Welcome mesh (You may use your own as long as it is 1 mesh/prim)
- Logo mesh / prim (You may use your own as long as it is 1 mesh/prim)
- Main Stand (Root prim)
- Link it.

All Auto Name Rendering models have options on menu to "hide" or "show" some "Elements", such as words and logo.

Link order for DIY model: (from first selection to last selection in-world)
░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
