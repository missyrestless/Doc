NOTECARDS:

Open the MILOTIPS DOCS, you will see several notecards explaining parts of the system. I recommend you read the HOW TO - BASIC SETUP notecard to start with.

Note that the notecards might be more up to date compared to the pdf.

Some recent features might not have been documented yet, in this case, please contact me.


PDF DOCUMENTATION:

I've been writing a documentation set as pdf files.
The idea is to provide a more visual and updated presentation of the different processes. The link bellow will give you access to this documentation.

As for now, it covers the basic setup for 1 or multiple servers. I'm going to complete this documentation set over time to cover all major subjects.

The pdf in the marketplace:

VIDEOS :
