BOARD FLIPS 
(NOT COMPATIBLE WITH REZZER BOARDS)

Tricks can be played over any animation on the surfboard. You can ride, spin, flip and rotate using the movement keys and then trigger the trick animation on top to style up your surfing. It's recommended that you trigger the animation first before doing the movement. This is especially important when doing movements that require two keys to be held like the Front/Back Flip and Flat/Sharp Turns.

*Example*
360 Judo Air, as you're approaching the crest of the wave, Press/Hold C and Release at the top to jump. Tap - key to trigger the Judo Grab and then press A or D to turn in the direction you want.

Air Reverse, is done by jumping off the lip of the wave and landing backwards on the wave. Press and Hold S to continue riding the wave backwards for a period of time and then cut out with a Sharp Turn or Power Slide.

-EXTRAS-
There are additional objects to create a "wake" at your hand and feet when performing tricks like the hand and foot drags for some added interaction and effect. Simply "Right-click" and "Add" each object.
