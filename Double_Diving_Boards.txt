LIGHTS
___________________________


Here is just simple advises to set and manage your lights

____________________
-> How to see lights

From your Viewer Preferences:

You need to active the "local light" to see them
You need to active the "Basic shaders" to make them looks right thanks to glow.

->> Menu -> "Preferences" -> "Graphics" -> check the left column ->  don't forget to press "OK" to validate changes

Note that the SL viewer can handle 6 light sources from any point of view

________________________________
-> How work the Tiki Tattoo Lights

->> To switch ON/OFF just "touch" them
(your cursor should be a "little hand" when you're over it)
->> To open the light manager do exact same BUT keep the mouse pressed 2 or 3 seconds before removing your finger.

___________________________
ANIMATIONS
___________________________

10 animations in each board -> "TOUCH" one of the board to use it  

->> to change animations, just "TOUCH" it while in use to open the menu manager

->> to adjust position and rotation, type chat command     /1a  while in use, to open the position manager
Note that the engine will remind the position & rotation of the last 50 users, so the adjustment just need to be done one time in your life in most case.
