** VIDEO TUTORIALS HERE: http://www.youtube.com/user/GalathirDarkstone **

The words echo in the back of your mind, like a nightmare haunting you from the darkest forgotten shadows of your childhood. The sound of them is alien and harsh at first... but as you find the cadence in them, it is as if the hint of music turns a key in the lock of their meaning... and the infernal syllables burrow into your skull, reverberating until the only thoughts left are the words themselves, suddenly revealed to your shattering mind...

"A Flight Assist for the winged beings in the sky,
A Radar for the watchful, to spy who's home,
A Microphone to shout with, as if from on high,
One HUD from the Dark Lord on his Dark Throne
In the Land of Sinners where the Wicked lie.
One HUD to Fit them all, One HUD to Size them,
One HUD to Change them all and with the Features bind them
In the Land of Sinners where the Wicked lie."

You have just managed to obtain one of the most technically advanced devices in all of SL: The Sinful Needs A4 HUD v2.0. This HUD is the culmination of months of work by Galathir Darkstone, and, among other things, will unlock the full potential of his Sinful Needs A4 Attachments & Accessories by giving you unprecedented control of Position, Size, Scale, Textures, Transparency, RGB Tinting, Brightness, Shine, and even Animation and Glow for ~every surface~ on these items. In addition, Galathir has integrated several widely sought-after devices into this HUD: the ZHAO-II AO (perhaps the single best AO in all of SL), an invitation-style Dance HUD (which supports 4 notecard configurable dance groups, random or sequential playback, Next & Previous dance buttons, up to 20 guest dancers, AND automatic disabling of the incorporated ZHAO-II AO), a fully-browseable Facial Animator (featuring one click "Toothy Smile" & "Angry" buttons, as well as a third programmable button, not to mention a 'Lock' feature to keep that Smile alive as long as you want or automatically trigger it at a configurable interval), a Smart Flight Assist (fly to any altitude, but maintain control near the ground), a Movelock, several Enhanced Movement Options (including Tracing: a Dash/Blink/Teleport, Super Speed while running, and a Super Leap - all toggle-able and configurable) a Multi-Channel Microphone (can be set to channel 1,2 or 3 to accommodate most Gestures without changing them), and a 16 Avatar, Color-Coded, Region-Load-Sensing Radar. Every component has been precision crafted and rigorously tested to provide you with the utmost in performance and utility. And to top it all off, all future updates will be delivered FREE and AUTOMATICALLY.

Yes... Congratulations are definitely in order. Excellent acquisition... your Second Life will never be the same!
