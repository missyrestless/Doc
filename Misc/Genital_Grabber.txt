    Thank you for choosing the [LE PREVOT] - Genital Grabber! This quick guide will help you set up your system step by step for the best experience.

1- Wear your Genital Grabber:
    Once worn, a dialog window will appear asking for your base genital (this defines the available actions). 
    You can choose between:
        - Cock
        - Pussy
2- If you selected Cock, the system will ask you to choose a brand. If your brand isn’t listed, just select a random one
    If you selected Pussy, you will go directly to step 3.
3- You will be asked to select your pronouns. A list of choices will be provided, and you can edit them anytime after the initial setup.
4- You will then be asked to choose a base voice for the "moans." This is independent of your genital and pronouns.
5- Finally, you will be asked whether you want to enable these sounds.

Note: If you accidentally close the dialog window, just click on the HUD to bring it back on screen.

The Genital Grabber will then start, and you can begin using it.

Additional customization is available:

 In the settings menu, you have multiple options: 
  - Security: Choose between Open or Whitelist mode. (The blacklist is always active, whether you use Open or Whitelist mode.)
  - Animations: Enable or disable all system animations.
  - Change Voice: Switch between masculine and feminine voices.
  - Rename Gen:  Rename your genital to something you prefer (e.g.:pecker).
  - Sounds: Enable or disable all sounds.
  - Change Genital :Swap your base genital. (Using a cock as a base enables actions like jerk; using a pussy enables actions like finger.)
  - Change Pronouns: Change your pronouns from a list or use "Custom.p*" to enter your own custom pronouns.
  - Cock Brand*: Change the base cock brand. (Required for full compatibility with supported cock animations.)
  
  Note for owners and users: A long click on your Genital Grabber opens a menu. Inform others if you want them to interact with it. 😉
