Instructions for previous Customers
-------------------------------------------

This is an update to your Hybrid Dance Machine.  This is a major update to fix various bugs notified to us from other customers.  Updates are automatically delivered to you from our Delivery Server in world when the update has been released.

As this is a major update we recommend that all calling posts and dance machines you have out in world are removed (you may wish to remove the animations contained in your current machine back to your inventory as the update will not contain your dances or a way to copy your dances from one machine to the other).  

You can always get an update of your full package in store at the ATM in our Customer Services area here:􀀀
