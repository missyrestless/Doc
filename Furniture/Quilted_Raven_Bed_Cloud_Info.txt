➤ NEW: Cloud Bed
The Cloud Bed is an included feature addon to the Bed which allows the porting of the bed to 6 different elevations and back to its original position in addition to optionally transforming the bed into a realistic cloud formation.
This capability adds several scripts and 2 prim to the base bed.

Are you tired of the neighbors watching you manhandle your wife? Is your mistress desperate to use her gacha angel wings during sex in a heavenly setting? We understand! Simply transport the bed to an elevation far from the hustle and bustle of real second life and transform it into a billowing cloud. It's fairly amazing; try at midnight setting for excellent photos. With two clicks the bed can be back in its original position as if nothing really happened. 
I promise she will love it. I do.
