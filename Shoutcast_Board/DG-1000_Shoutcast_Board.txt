Problem: i add names to the Manager list notecard but still says:no access....what did i do wrong?
possible reasons:
1.check if you add display names, according to the data server display names ar not accepted by the system.
YOU MUST ADD only legacy names (account names)
2.if names comes from web profiles for example (daffy.proto), remove the dot in the middle (daffy proto).
3.ONE NAME EACH NEW LINE, do not add multiple names at the same line.
4.try to avoid gaps between the lines.
5.DO NOT ADD ANY OTHER CHARACTERS EXCEPT CLEARLY AVATAR NAMES.

you start new line for each dj that have 4 parts and go with that order:

1st Part. add the URL streamer of DJ.....continue with separator*
2nd Part. add the FULL username (avatar name) NOTE:DO NOT USE DISPLAY NAMES.....continue with separator*
3rd Part. add the dj name and this displaying to the board example:DJ DAFFY LIVE NOW!.....continue with separator*

Problem: i add radio to the Radio Stations notecard but now i don't have radio menu or got error...what did i do wrong?
it is possible to add the name of radio in more than 24 characters (including spaces)
which means the menu dialog don't accept more than 24 characters and the script got error..
open the radio stations notecard and find which radio station have a large name and shrink the name of this (less than 24 characters)

Problem: ok now the ShoutCast is working But Doesn't Show the Photo..why is that?

Problem: i cannot listen any radio station at all in my land!
Solution: hmm did you rez the DGX Receiver? if not click the manager button and Select REZ DGX to rez the receiver.
IF the land is under Group owned, Deed the receiver (NOT THE BOARD) into the same group as the land.
IF the land owned to you, do not deed the receiver. just rez it and leave it as is.
IF the land is owned by someone else (one person) give the receiver to this person and ask him to rez the receiver.

Problem: ok i add all tha information that needed to the dj station nc but STILL Display NO SONG INFORMATION!
------FOR SHOUTCAST STREAMERS-------
Answer: every streamer in the notecards must be CLEAR! which means must start with: http...end with the port number
AND NOT other further informations of url stream.

http://38.86.49.3:9832/index.html?sid  = WRONG
http://38.86.49.3:9832/blablabla  = WRONG
http://85.25.43.55:8100  = CORRECT

Problem:Everything good until now but now some of my dj's  play music and the board don't show song information.
Answer: it is very possible, the issue comes from the program that use a dj.
possible reasons:
some program players don't have the ability to display titles if are cracked, and don't send metadata to the streamer totally..
the dj that use the broadcast player Disable the song titles, for its own reasons.

Question:as owner i am i have a dj menu but instead of login says (CLICK & READ)...what is that, and why i don't have login button?
Answer: Please Click that button and read the information in nearby chat:
Yes you have Menu But Without DJ Login Button.
This Means Even if you are  Owner, the board need Informations (streamer,display name, profile pic) .
add your information To the '*DJ Stations' Notecard.

Question:HEY...i resize the board larger and increase the prims. why this happening??
Answer: the board is 100% mesh, and we all know in mesh items
the more size you give, the more prims count (land impact), so please don't blame me...blame lindens
