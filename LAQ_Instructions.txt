Era2 by LAQ - Finest Detailed Heads 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Congratulations on your Era2 Head by LAQ! This creation features beautiful designs and cutting-edge technology. We hope you'll enjoy wearing this piece of art. Please join our group for LAQ exclusive benefits!

While Era2 offers 3 UV maps, we want to emphasize the benefits of our exclusive SupremeUHD map, that makes the center of the face supremely detailed. 
How can it? Does it slow down performance? The answer is no: UHD is not 4 skins tiled together. Nor does it have separate ears. 
So what is UHD? Developed by veteran skin designers. UHD optimizes the UV space to emphasize the details of the face, while the ears and back of head is slightly out of focus - like you would see in portrait photos. Keeping everything in one texture actually means faster loading. 

To summarize: SupremeUHD means 4x the details of other skins, and 2x faster loading. This, in our humble opinion, makes SupremeUHD the pinnacle of skin quality!
