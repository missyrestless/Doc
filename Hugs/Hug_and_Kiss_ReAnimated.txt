Thank you for your interest in the Hug & Kiss 3 :  ReAnimated


Strike & Heston's Hug & Kiss 3: ReAnimated is a complete re-imagining of the original Hug & Kiss Animator by Meike Heston. The animations have been re-created from scratch: just as cute, but even better then before! 

The new animator combines 22 variations of each animation to create the best possible height matching between smaller and taller avatars. This means we created 352 animations in total to help you along in your quest for the perfect hug or kiss.

Caveats:

- It is inherent to this system that poses might not always align optimally. You line up the avatars, we do the rest. 
- There are 11 steps in the height matching system so the interaction will be acceptable, within each step there might still be slight but noticeable height differences.
- Updates / upgrades from the 1.x and 2.x versions are not possible, these products have been obsolete for about 10 years. Copies which may still be sold now are pirated items.

You will now see the HUD appear on the top right side of the screen.

# Updating
#

Updates are automatically provided through the Casper Update system. each time the object is rezzed, it will check wether your version is still up to date. When then is a new version, you will get an update dialog where you can choose whether to receive it or not.

YES! - receive the update
Not now - You will be offered the dialog again the next time the HUD is rezzed, after one hour is past. 
Postpone - Decline this update, wait for the next version
Never - Never receive updates again

If you accidentally picked the wrong option, you can always get the update manually by having it redelivered through the vendor or marketplace.

# Hints, Tips and frequently asked questions
#


* The height matching system happens automatically without any need for you to set any preferences except for Male or Female.

* When you attach the Hug & Kiss to a new attachment point on your screen, it will automatically be placed in an appropriate position. You can adjust this to fit, and will remember the adjustments when you reattach to the same point.

* Other attachments may cause the Hug & Kiss to fail, keeping the two participants to far away from each other to make the animations fit. This are often anti push scripts or shields.
