This relay is meant to be dropped in "The V" made by Session Skins (Anj4) so you can use Sensations Body Shine on it.

I'm aware some people prefer the "The V" design over my vagina, but still choose to use the Ass v7 and/or Boobs v7, so I made this.

Drop the script inside the root prim, after you've rezzed it on the ground.  Then just use a Sensations Body Shine applier and it should work.







To change Blend Mode for the Skin say:
/9 masking 0      (None)
/9 masking 1      (Alpha Blended)
/9 masking 2      (Alpha Masking)
/9 masking 3      (Emissive Masking)
