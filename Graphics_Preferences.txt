Greetings from Tiki Tattoo!

Here is just a simple advise to make your "Mesh Life" better.
Mesh details is  based on distance . For that reason, better to improve your graphics preferences.
Here is what I can suggest you, from my little SL experience, to have better mesh without consequences on your graphics perfomances:

-> Menu "Me"
-> "Preferences"
-> "Graphics"
-> if not already done, choose "Advanced" to acces the graphics details.
-> Start to set the "Objects" cursor to the max. and "OK"
-> if your computer become lazy because of this, just adjust the "Draw Distance", the lower the better, and in most case, a 200m setting is much enough.(draw distance is themost influent setting for your perf)

-> Others can be adjusted too, but with less consequences on your SL experience. 
It's good to reduce the "max non imposotr avatars" if you use an old computer.
On my side:
 "Max particule count" is set  to 256
"Max non-impostor avatars" to 12
"Post process quality" to max
"Objects" to max
"Flexiprims" in middle
 "trees" to low "  (not so many trees now in SL though)
"Avatars" to low/mid
"terrain" to max
"sky" to mid

 Avatar Physics, and water reflections, rendering, etc... is really based on your computer performances... 


Aims here wasn't here to give you a lesson, I'm not enough good for this, just an advise! ;)
