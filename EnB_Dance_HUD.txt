FAQ
Q: Does the price include animations?
A: no, animations may be purchased inworld separately 

Q: Can you specify the time per specific animation?
A: no, this feature was left out deliberately for being unreliable due to inconsistent Second Life Server animations loading times.

Q: can I use couple animations with those dance huds?
A: no, only since animations are supported, couple dance HUDs are usually a separate product and use pose balls.

Q: sometimes I don’t stop dancing even though I pressed stop, can I do anything about it?
A: this is a well known and documented issue with llStopAnimation that will probably never be fixed by Second Life, the simple solution for it is to simply move and it will stop.
