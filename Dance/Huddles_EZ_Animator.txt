BEFORE YOU START

HUD's are attachments that appear on your screen. To put on the EZ Animator,
just "Wear" it from you inventory. You may also attach it to any other HUD 
position. To take it off, right click on it and choose "Detach".

I. QUICK START

    A. ADDING ANIMATIONS
    There are two ways to add animations to your EZ Animator:
        -   For animations with limited permissions (no copy or no transfer)
            -- Drag the EZ Animator from your inventory to the ground.
            -- Right click on it and choose 'Open'
            -- Drag animations from your inventory into the contents of the EZ Animator.
        -  For full permissions animations you may also simply drag a copy from your 
            inventory and drop it onto the HUD while wearing it.
        
    B. PLAYING ANIMATIONS
    Just click the name of the animation you want to play. Remember for long 
    animations, it may take a moment for it to load to your client, just like a 
    large texture.
    
    C. BROWSING ANIMATIONS
    Use the arrow keys just below the animation names to browse all the animations
    in the HUD's inventory. From left to right the buttons are:
        |<<     First Page
        <<      Previous
        >>      Next
        >>|     Last Page
        
    D. DANCE AND RANDOM MODE
    The Dance button is the middle button in the first row of buttons. It looks like 
    a man dancing. When you click on this button, you begin "dance" mode. The 
    EZ Animator will begin with the first animation in the HUD's inventory and play
    each animation in order.
    
    The Random button looks like a die. It's on the left in the second row. Random 
    mode works exactly like the Dance mode except that it chooses a random order
    to play the animations in.
    
    To stop Dance or Random mode, simply click the button again or click the "Stop" 
    button. The stop button is square icon in the middle button in the second row.
    
    E. NEXT DANCE
    When in Dance or Random mode, you may skip to the next song by clicking the 
    "Next" button--the single arrow icon on the right of the second row.
    
    F. MINIMIZING AND MOVING HUD
    To minimize the EZ Animator, click the Minimize button on the top right corner 
    of the device. It will shrink to a small bar with one button. This is the Restore
    button used to restore the HUD on your screen.
    
    To move the HUD on your screen, right click on it and choose "Edit." Use the 
    blue and green arrows to drag it somewhere else on the screen.
    
    The EZ Animator remembers two positions, the position it was last minimized
    and the position it was last full size. So, you can choose an out of the way
    spot to position it while minimized and it will return there whenever you minimize it.
    
    IMPORTANT - If you ever attach the EZ Animator to a new HUD position, it will 
    clear the last saved positions. This is a feature, if for some reason you attach the
    HUD and you don't see it on your screen, attach it to different HUD spot.
    
    G. HELP BUTTON
    At the top of the HUD is a button which has a question mark for an icon. Click on 
    this button and a copy of this notecard will pop on your screen.
    

II. DANCER OPTIONS
The EZ Animator not only animates you, but up to 10 friends as well. This is most 
often used for dancing, but there are other applications for it as well.

    A. INVITING DANCERS (and the HUDDLES Dance Ball)
    There are two ways for others to join your EZ Animator:
    -  The Invite button (the envelope icon next to the Random button) brings up 
        a list of the 16 closest avatars (use the arrow keys to see the last six). To invite
        one to dance, click their name. 
        -- If you don't wish to invite someone on the list, click the invite button again
            to return to normal operation.
    -  You can also wear the HUDDLES Dance Ball. It is an invisible prim that attaches
        to your avatar. Someone else can click on it to start dancing with you and to 
        stop dancing with you. You do not need to be wearing the Dance Ball to invite
        others to dance with you.
    
    B. REMOVING DANCERS AND CLEARING DANCER LIST
    The button with two dancers is for removing dancers from your EZ Animator. 
    Click on this button and a list of your current dancers will pop up. Click on one of
    the names to remove them from your EZ Animator, or choose "CLEAR ALL" to 
    remove everyone.
    
    C. SELF ANIMATION
    There are times when you will not want to animate yourself, but still animate 
    the dancers on your EZ Animator. To turn off self animation, click the "Me" button.
    To turn it back on, click it again.

III. ADMIN OPTIONS

    A. SILENT MODE
    This button looks like a bullhorn. Click it to turn "Silent Mode" on or off. In silent
    mode, the vast majority of chat spam is eliminated.
    
    B. DANCE TIME INTERVAL
    The button that looks like a wrist watch is the button to set a new Dance Time
    Interval. Click it and then type in a number of seconds to set the time between
    dances in Dance or Random mode. The default time is 20 seconds.
    
    C. CHANGING HUD ALPHA (TRANSPARENCY)
    The alpha (or transparency) button looks like a cursive "a". Click in and then 
    choose how transparent you want your HUD to be.
    
    D. CHANGING HUD COLOR
    The color button is last. Click it and then choose a color for the buttons on your
    HUD.

**** Please note that this HUD attachment was created with the screen set to: 1024 x 768 and looks best at that screen resolution. It works fine at other resolutions, but the text will be smaller or bigger depending on your settings. ****
