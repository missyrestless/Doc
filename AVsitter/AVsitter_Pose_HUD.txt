HOW TO USE THE SET
--------------------------

Attach the HUD

First, wear the "AVsitter Pose HUD" on your avatar. This HUD provides the controls to adjust your avatar's position. You can move and resize the HUD by right-clicking it, selecting Edit, and then using the white handles to adjust its position and size.

Add the Script

Next, right-click on your furniture and select Edit. Go to the Contents tab, where you'll see all the existing AVsitter files. Drag and drop the "AVsitter Pose Script" into the same prim where the AVsitter files are located, which is usually the ROOT prim. The script will automatically compile once you add it.

Get to Work

Once the script has compiled, sit on the furniture. Use the HUD to instantly adjust the position of either SITTER 0 or SITTER 1. The HUD allows you to seamlessly switch between controlling the two sitters.

For detailed instructions on each button's function, refer to the enclosed "AVsitter POSE HUD SET ADV".
