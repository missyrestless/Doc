How to install your tip them all jar:

You will find a diamond and a tip box in the folder.

If you want to use a custom object as a tipjar, use the tip box and follow this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdYIuBRFT_Q&list=PL74OSW_BxGSU5SvjzNWB6Gxo7VuQ6ODZE&index=2

Or this notecard : HOW TO - CUSTOM MESH TIP JAR

Otherwise just rezz the diamond or the UFO Diamond.


====================
 TIP THEM ALL version v2.79r5c
====================


1) Rezz out the tip them all diamond / box on the ground

2) Make sure the channel corresponds to the tipjars channel : Click the tip them all jar and click CHANNEL to adjust the channel if needed.

Note that it's possible to link a single tip them all jar to multiple channels, like this for instance: 1,2 (it would connect to channel 1 and 2 tipjars). 

If you use multiple channels, make sure a single user won't be able to use the 2 tipjars, as they would get paid twice.

3) Adjust the title in TEXT => TITLE

It is possible to enter 2 lines of text.


4) Set the spin, size and visual options in OPTIONS

5) Set the pay buttons in MONEY

 + Suggested is the minimum amount and will show in the free amount field.
 + buttons will let you enter 4 values : 200,400,800,1200 for instance

6) Click START anytime to activate the tip them all jar.


VIP MODE (New method in v2.79r5)
======================

This option has been updated again in the version v2.79r5. It's now possible to use the same tip all jar for regular and vip (discounted) tips.

+ Right click and edit the tipjar, and use the wrench button right next to the group name and choose the VIP group. 

+ Access the tipjar menu

+ Go to Money, and click on vip

+ The first time you click on it, it asks for debit permissions. This is to allow refunding the vip based on his discount. You must allow it.

+ Once in the vip section, you see 6 slots. Each slots allows you to set a different group tag ( = role title) that would benefit from a vip discount.

+ Click on 1 to set a first tag ( then later, 2, 3 ... 6 if you have more than one vip tag in the vip group).

+ Click on modify to set or modify the tag (that must be exactly the same as the role title in your group), then submit.

+ Click on discount % and enter the discount value for thihs tag (without the % symbol).

+ You can then go back and add more tags if you want.


CONFIG OPTION
==========

(new in v2.78)

You can limit the tip all to tipjars that are set to a certain "sub config a,b or c", within a unique channel. This allows you to use several separate tip all jars without the need to use several servers.

1) set your tipjars to the desired config: click on the jar -> SETTINGS -> CONFIG and a,c or c.

2) set the tip all tip jar to the corresponding config: Click on the tip all jar, then OPTIONS -> config -> a,b or c  (click all to make it connect to any tipjar).


RANDOM MODE
==========

By default, the tip all jar tips all the connected jars.
The random mode allows to set it to pay 1,2,3 or 4 people choosen randomly.

To activate : Click on MONEY then RANDOM, then 1,2,3 or 4, that will define how many dancers/ jars users will be choosen.

Click disable to go back to the normal mode.
