# AVsitter Sequence for Tm Creation Adult Sandcastle

This folder contains the `AVpos` and `[AV]sequence_settings` notecards for use
with the `AVsitter2` plugin `[AV]sequence` to provide animation sequences for
the Tm Creation Adult Sandcastle dialog menus.

This `AVsitter` customization allows greater freedom of personal interaction on the
sandcastle, eliminating the need to navigate dialog menus during moments of intimacy.

## Download the script and customized notecards

Download the `[AV]sequence` plugin script:

```bash
wget -q -O '[AV]sequence' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AVsitter/AVsitter/refs/heads/master/AVsitter2/Plugins/AVsequence/%5BAV%5Dsequence.lsl
```

Download the customized `[AV]sequence_settings` notecard:

```bash
wget -q -O '[AV]sequence_settings' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/missyrestless/Doc/refs/heads/main/AVsitter/Sandcastle/AVsequence_settings
```

Download the customized `AVpos` notecard:

```bash
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/missyrestless/Doc/refs/heads/main/AVsitter/Sandcastle/AVpos
```

## Setup

To configure a Tm Creation Adult Sandcastle with AVsitter sequences:

- Right click the sandcastle and select `Edit`
- Select the Contents tab in the Edit window
- Click the `Edit linked` checkbox
- Using `Ctrl .` (press both the Ctrl key and the Period key) locate the notecards (Link number 2)
- Delete the `AVpos` and `[AV]sequence_settings` notecards in the Contents tab
- Drag and Drop the `[AV]sequence_settings` notecard into the Contents tab
- Drag and Drop the `AVpos` notecard into the Contents tab
- Close the `Edit` window
- Wait for the scripts to reset (this takes a few minutes)
- If the Sandcastle scripts do not reset properly or a warning is issued during reset:
  - Right click the sandcastle and select `More` -> `More` -> `Scripts` -> `Reset Scripts`

Sit on the sandcastle. You should see menu entries of the form `SEQ_...`. Click one of these menu
entries and your avatar will cycle through all the animations in that submenu. Cycle times are
currently set to 60 seconds with menu arrows to step to the next animation, previous animation,
or pause animation sequencing.

### Auto Play Sequence

If you wish to automatically play a sequence when an avatar sits on the sandcastle then
download the `autoplay.sl` script and copy it into the Contents tab of the linked prim.

```bash
wget -q -O 'autoplay' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/missyrestless/Doc/refs/heads/main/AVsitter/Sandcastle/autoplay.lsl
```

The `autoplay` script detects the gender of the sitter and plays the appropriate sequence.
In addition, it detects the number of sitters currently on the object and plays the couples
animation sequence if more than 1 sitter is seated.
