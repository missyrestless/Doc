:::::::::::::::::FAQ::::::::::::::::::::::
 
This Ao will only work on Bento viewer. To see finger movements, you need bento compatible hands.
My fingers do not move: If you have bento hands and the fingers doesn't move, check if you are wearing a HUD with static hands pose animation on it. (ex Maître hud)
My Ao only show a few stands: Check if you have proximity ON, or you have selected the model Calm or MODE2. Also check if you have the cycling ON.
What is proximity?: Is a radar that will detect near people and will deactivate the "walking stands" avoiding collisions with other avatars.
 
The stands take a while to load: These are bento animations, that take a little longer to load, also they need to reload more often in the cache. So, use next arrow to pass through all the stands making them load in cache.
I am sitting under the ground!: The Ao include 3 levels of sitting that activate automatically. But really short avatars or extremely tall could not match a correct position on the sit grounds.
Could I Add animations to my Ao?: Yes! It is mod, but take care, the memory is really limited. Try to add a few animations and test, and so on.
Could I combine with other Bento AO’s?: Yes, but remember the memory limits, also Miriam has 60 seconds stands, this is 30. We made them 30 because they load faster.
