1.  Loading Instructions

    a.  Locate the collar you wish to use the custom leash textures in and rez it on the ground
    b.  Edit the collar by right-clicking on it and selecting "Edit"
    c.  Go to the Contents tab
    d.  Locate the script in Contents that is titled "OpenCollar - leashParticle"
    e.  Right click on this script and choose "Delete".  Make sure you are only selecting the leashParticle script and that no 
         other contents are highlighted before deleting.  But don't worry if, after selecting delete, you notice all the contents 
         disappear for 30 seconds or more.  This happens as the scripts in the object are resetting themselves.
    f.  Locate the Custom Leash Texture Package you just purchased in your inventory.
    g.  Drag each of the textures from your inventory into your collar.  Make sure you are still in "Edit" mode on the collar 
        before doing this, and the next, step.
    h.  Locate the script in your Custom Leash Texture Package titled "OpenCollar - leashParticle".  NOTE:  the script is 
        named exactly as the one you just deleted from the collar because of the way OC script naming works together.  If 
        you open the custom leash script, you'll notice the name of the specific custom script near the top of the text.
    i.  Drag the new script from your inventory into the collar.
    j.  Close the "Edit" box on your collar.
    k.  Right click on your collar, select "Edit" again.
    l.  In the top menu on your SL viewer, select "Tools", then "Reset Scripts in Selection".
    m.  You're done!  Your new leash textures and script are ready for use.


2.  Use Instructions
    
    a.  Wear the collar to which you have added the Custom Leash Texture scripts and textures.
    b.  Click on the collar (or have your collar's owner click on it) to bring up the menu.
    c.  Select "Collar Menu", then "Leash", then "L-Options", then "Texture".
    d.  Choose the name of the texture you wish to be displayed when your leash is active.  NOTE:  selecting "noTexture" 
          will display a white ball/star-like texture.
    e.  If you wish to change the size of the texture, or its density (which is how closely together the texture particles are 
        displayed), select either "Size" or "Density" in the "L-Options" menu.  
    f.  If you wish to change the color, select "Color".  NOTE:  for most custom textures, changing the color from white to 
        anything else will tint the texture to some combination of the original texture colors and the color you select.  If you're 
        using the Jewels Custom Leash Package, the color you select will change the texture from diamond to some other 
        (green = emerald, red = ruby, etc.).


3.  License and Terms

    a.  The contents of Custom Leash Texture Packages are sold with full perms in order for them to work properly with the

    b.  You may use the textures in your other build projects, but you may not sell these as full perms in any other package 
         or individually.  You may also not provide them as gifts to other avatars or your own alts with full perms enabled.  
         You must change the permissions to either copy only or mod/transfer only when using them in any other project.
    c.  When notified that these textures are being used without proper authorization, in violation of this license and terms, 
         I will take whatever action is necessary to protect my intellectual and other property rights, including notification to 
         LL and RL legal action if necessary.  
    d.  Please comply with proper use instructions.  Creators put a lot of time and effort into their products.  Theft only 
         discourages them from creating new products for your use and generally diminishes the creativity of Second Life.
