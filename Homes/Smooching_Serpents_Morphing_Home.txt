- Quick Manual -


Setting Up the platform:

1. Place the platform with the heartlock on the ground and rotate it as you wish.
2. If you want to make it a skybox you can sit on the object, select edit from the pie menu and choose the height you want.
3. The three house modules included in this version are already in the platform's inventory.
4. If you want to add more modules, drag and drop them from your inventory into the platform. (module names start with a ">")
5. Now you can touch the heartlock:

Heartlock Menu:
- Select House: select your house and rez it.
- Public: Set menu access to public, group, or owner. In public mode anyone can change houses. The houses then will appear with an unlocked Key menu (see below).
- AddPlatform: If you use it as a skybox, you might want to add a platform the house is standing on, surrounding it with an invisible prim so that nobody falls down. 
- AddBasement: Adds only a basement (an additional big room!) without an invisible prim. So you can also use this on the ground.
- AddSkyBase: Adds a basement with an invisible prim.
- Info: gives you this NC ;-)
- Reboot: Reboots the whole thing.


Selecting a House:
1. Touch the heartlock and click "SelectHouse". Now choose your house style.
2. Now the white platform vanishes and your house will appear. Wait until it is fully rezzed.
3. Some furniture needs to test animations. (Please allow animating your avatar on request!)
4. Now a key in the heartlock is rezzed. Touch this key for further customization of the rezzed house:

Key Menu:
- Lock/Unlock: key menu access set to owner or public (the doors of the house won't lock though!)
- CountPrims: counts the prims belonging to the one who clicks this button
- Furnishing: rez/unrez furniture
- Design: change the textures of the house

Look around in the house, touch everything, there are many hidden specials! Enjoy!
