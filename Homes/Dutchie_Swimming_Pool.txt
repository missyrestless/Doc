• Tread & Float (solo)
• Together (couple)
• Passion (couple)

REALISTIC WATER EFFECTS & UNDERWATER LIGHTS

Dives and jumps trigger splash effects, adding realism to every movement. Soft underwater lighting creates beautiful reflections for an immersive ambiance. Right-click on the pool border to rez the underwater lights.

-----

PLACING THE SWIMMING POOL

For a natural, in-ground look, Dutchie's Swimming Pool is designed to be placed below ground level, requiring land editing rights to dig a hole. A footprint of the pool is available in-world at Dutchie, allowing you to test the placement on your land before purchasing.

-----

EXTRA TRAVERTINE TILES & POOL SURROUNDS

If in-ground placement isn't possible, the pool can also be used as a raised structure. To enhance this setup, a selection of travertine tile pieces is included, allowing you to create pathways, terraces, and seamless transitions around your Dutchie Swimming Pool.

Additionally, two large, texturable prims with a rectangular cutout assist with pool placement. If the terrain cannot be lowered enough, these surrounds create a gentle slope leading up to the pool. The outer edge can be adjusted downward while keeping the inner edge level with the water, ensuring a smooth, natural effect. Apply your own land or stone textures to seamlessly blend the pool into your environment.

-----

PLEASE READ: BUG WHERE THE WATER TEXTURE STOPS

A known animated texture bug may cause the water animation to stop for some users. Firestorm and Linden Lab are working on a fix. If this happens, simply right-click on the water, and it will start again.

LOVENSE SEX TOY COMPATIBILITY

You can connect your real-life Lovense sex toy to our Second Life sex furniture. When you play a masturbation, FP, or sex animation, your Lovense sex toy will vibrate. And you have full control over the intensity.

Plus, both you and your partner will feel the same level of vibrations, ensuring a shared and electrifying experience, regardless of the specific Lovense sex toy you use or your gender.


How to play with Dutchie's Lovense Second Life sex furniture

The process is straightforward. Each adult sub-menu and sequence starts with gentle vibrations, which gradually increase in intensity as you progress. Start out with soft vibrations and slowly increase the intensity, until you find a level that feels good to you. If you prefer softer vibrations, you can always go back to a lower level.

The sequences are designed to step up by one level every minute. Simply push the pause button when you find the right level of intensity.
