Hey there! We wanted to offer big congratulations on purchasing your LeLUTKA product!

We're thrilled to have you as part of the LeLUTKA family, and we genuinely appreciate you choosing our brand. 
We understand that picking out the perfect product can be a bit overwhelming, but now that you've made your choice, let's get started on the fun part - discovering and enjoying your new product(s)!


Do you like to improve your avatar? If so, you might be interested in the Evolution Xtreme (Evo X) - a custom-created UV map by LeLUTKA that is designed to help improve your avatar's appearance. We know that skin designers face many challenges with the Second Life UV map and its limitations, so we created a more detailed and sharper UV map beyond the standard SL UV.

With the EvoX line of heads, you have two options to choose from: the default SL map (Classic) or the custom-created Evo X map. You can easily switch between the two by clicking on a button.

We've removed the Applier option for skins as Bakes on Mesh and its stacking option make it unnecessary. However, you can still create and wear materials for the heads via Appliers. We've also kept the HD Layers (Brow, Eyeshadow, and Lip) so that you can continue enjoying all the beautiful content created, whether you are in Classic or Evo X mode.

If you're using the new Evo X heads, you'll notice that ear textures have been moved to a separate UV and are now added using a UNIVERSAL Layer (Aux 1). You'll need to add your ear textures separately, but don't worry - we've included these layers with your head, labeled EARS - lel EvoX. Universal layers can also be stacked, so you can create ear tattoos, which are added just like other system layers.

One thing to keep in mind is that while in EVO X mode, you won't be able to wear content created with the default (Classic) UV, such as tattoos and hairbases.

We hope you enjoy the new Evo X features and all the possibilities they offer for customizing your avatar!

Enjoy!

✖✖✖ IMPORTANT ✖✖✖

Evolution Heads were stripped of excessive mesh layers and we focused on Bakes on Mesh and HD layers instead to lower the game play impact. 

 OMEGA APPLIERS  WILL NOT WORK ON EVOLUTION X LINE OF HEADS.
