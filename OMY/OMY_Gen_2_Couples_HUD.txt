Thank you so much for your purchase!

Gen2 HUDS animate both avatars

All  of our HUDS are created specifically for the people that are just dying to latch on to their favorite avatar and get and give some LOVE!

Our couples huds not only allow you to just grab on to your target....but also allows you to stand beside them (Left or Right of your choice) and walk with them as they move around. Great for exploring sims, shopping and much more, all while staying close by.

We've allowed for detailed customization when you grab on to the selected avatar, by including arrows on the hud  (X Y & Z) where you can move yourself around. So your avi looks perfect!
To rotate your avatar...simply use your left and right arrow keys on your keyboard to turn yourself.

No rez rights needed. You can grab on and follow anyone...anywhere!

Next Gen2 UPDATE:


Whats new?

We have updated our scripts allowing for 5 position save slots and click and hold down X Y or Z for faster adjustments. We have also given the hud a sleek new face lift and fixed some bugs.

SAVE SLOTS: 

You can now save your favorite positions for each pose. So when you swap to another pose you can simply click the PLAY button adjacent to the presaved slot you saved in and.... VOILA! There is also a reset button if you ever need to revert back to original positions.
Rotations are not able to be saved so please keep that in mind.


CLICK AND HOLD X Z & Z:

For easy adjusting we have added a click hold on X Y or Z buttons. You can now adjust your avatar easier with less clicks.



*General bug fixes*

Please take note of which gender hud you are purchasing as it is designed for male or female.

Because the animations are very detailed, animating with someone that has a drastically larger or smaller frame than you, may result in animations not fitting correctly. The animations were designed to use with avatars with average frames and heights. For reference, the avatars were animated with a 1 ft height difference for best alignment.

For best alignment, it's recommended to face the same direction of your target then open the hud and then adjust as needed.

If you find you animations are not synced, press 'ctrl+s'

Happy Hudding
