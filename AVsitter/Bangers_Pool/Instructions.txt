AVsitter Sequences for Nerenzo Hot Bangers Pool 
----------------------------------------------------------

This folder contains the 'AVpos' and '[AV]sequence_settings' notecards for use with the 'AVsitter2' plugin '[AV]sequence' to provide animation sequences for the Nerenzo Hot Bangers Pool dialog menus.

This 'AVsitter' customization allows greater freedom of personal interaction in the pool, eliminating the need to navigate dialog menus during moments of intimacy.

IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------------

This product does NOT contain the Nerenzo Hot Bangers Pool. You have to purchase the pool from Nerenzo. This product only contains the notecards and scripts used to provide sequenced animations for the pool. This customization of the Nerenzo Hot Bangers Pool only works with the Adult Swingers version available on the Second Life Marketplace at https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/Nerenzo-Hot-Bangers-pool-swingers-version-theP-theV-INM-cumclean-aeros-bento/24148103

In order to deploy this customization it will be necessary to edit the pool object. Detailed instructions are provided below but if you are not comfortable editing Second Life objects then this may be viewed as an opportunity to learn or as something not for you.

Missy Restless and the Truth & Beauty Lab are not affiliated with Nerenzo products in any way other than as an extremely satisfied customer.

MENUS
--------

Sequences are configured for Sitter 0 and Sitter 1 menus, both male and female. The 3rd and 4th sitter menus do not have sequences configured - you're on your own with 3-ways and 4-ways.

Currently configured sequenced menus include:

- Solo Menus
- Cuddle Menus
- Foreplay and Tongue Play Menus
- Blow Job Menus
- Butt Stuff Menus
- Fuck Menus
- Hard Sex Menus

SETUP
-------

Prior to modifying the pool make a backup! Things can go wrong. Mistakes are made. If you do not already have a backup, right click the pool and select 'Take' then 'Take Copy'. Your original product package is also a good backup if you saved it or can get redelivery. And I have made a backup of the original 'AVpos' notecard for you at https://github.com/missyrestless/Doc/blob/main/AVsitter/Bangers_Pool/Original-AVpos

To configure a Nerenzo Hot Bangers Pool with AVsitter sequences:

1. Right click the pool and select 'Edit'

2. Select the Contents tab of the Edit window (on the far right)

3. Drag and drop the '[AV]sequence_settings' notecard into the Contents tab

4. Drag and drop the '[AV]sequence' plugin script into the Contents tab

5. Replace the 'AVpos' notecard in the Contents tab with the 'AVpos' notecard found in this folder
  - Drag and drop the original 'AVpos' notecard from the Contents to your Inventory as a backup
  - Delete the 'AVpos' notecard fromthe Contents of the pool object
    - Deleting the original 'AVpos' notecard will trigger a warning message that can be ignored
  - Drag and drop the 'AVpos' notecard from this folder to the Contents of the pool object
  - Alternately, open the original 'AVpos', delete the contents of the notecard, copy & paste the new 'AVpos' contents and Save

6. Close the 'Edit' window

7. Right click the pool and select 'More' -> 'More' -> 'Scripts' -> 'Reset Scripts'

8. Wait for the scripts to reset (this takes a few minutes)

Sit on the pool, select one of the first two sitters (Male or Female), and click one of the three configured main menu entries, 'SINGLE/TALK', 'CUDDLE', or 'SEX'.

You should see a menu entry of the form 'SEQ-...'. Click this menu entry and your avatar will cycle through all the animations in that submenu. Cycle times are currently set to 60 seconds with menu arrows to step to the next animation, previous animation, or pause animation sequencing.

AUTO PLAY SEQUENCE
--------------------------

If you wish to automatically play a sequence when an avatar sits on the pool then drag & drop the 'autoplay' script into the Contents of the object.

The 'autoplay' script detects the gender of the sitter and plays the appropriate sequence. In addition, it detects the number of sitters currently on the object and plays the couples animation sequence if more than 1 sitter is seated.
