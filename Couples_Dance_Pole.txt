‚ú™ ANIMATED LUXURY DANCE POLE - PBR ONLY ‚ú™

‚ú≠ PLEASE NOTE: This item uses PBR textures and REQUIRES AN UPDATED VIEWER to display correctly. If you have any doubts go to the IW store to see the Demo.

‚ú™ THIS PACKAGE ALSO INCLUDES THE SINGLE VERSION: DANCER ONLY.

‚ú≠ Some male animations are repeated as they are used both in the single menu, to allow the viewer avatar to express themselves freely, and in a couple menu (Tease).
This is intentional and is intended to provide a better and more enjoyable experience when using the object.
The dancer can use the ‚ÄòSEQ üîÉ Pole‚Äô menu to perform an independent and professional pole dance and the ‚ÄòTease‚Äô menu to perform a pole dance synchronised with the viewer's animations.
The other menus are for couples and can therefore be activated by both avatars.
