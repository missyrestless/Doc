###  Note that either this notecard OR one single landmark are needed for the script to function.  

###  If you use this notecard you can overrule the menu and destination by  
### dropping a landmark inside to force the destination. Useful for special  
### events/days. Remove the landmark to re-enable all destinations again.

###    CONFIGURATION     ##
#####################

# ACCESS - Either 'Anyone', 'Group' or 'Owner'
# NOTE: make sure you have a group set on your teleporter object when you want to use group access.

ACCESS                  = Anyone

# ACCESS_DENIED - a custom message to display when the user has no access to use the teleporter. 
# NOTE: the tag [ACCESS] will be replaced by the actual access level set above.

ACCESS_DENIED  = I'm sorry this teleporter is set to be used by [ACCESS] only.

# HOVER_TEXT - A text displayed in hovertext. Like 'Teleport' or 'To the event'...
# Note: clear the value if you wish to clear the hover text. ie: HOVER_TEXT          = 
# Default: Destinations

HOVER_TEXT          = 

# INFO_TEXT - Allows you to remove even the temporary informative text like 'busy' when in use.
# Note: in case you want a completely invisible prim this could help. otherwise not recommended.
# Note: format: 'Yes' or 'No'  Default: Yes

INFO_TEXT               = Yes

# TOUCH - activate on touching the prim.
# Note: In case no animation is present,,the user gets the menu or gets instantly teleported depending on the presence of a LM inside.
# Note: In case there IS an animation present, the user is made to sit on the prim on touch first, 
# then either gets the menu, or gets teleported after sitting, depending the presence of a LM inside.
# Note: format: 'Yes' or 'No'

TOUCH                     = Yes

# TOUCH_TEXT - Short txt displayed on the pie menu when right clicking the prim for touch
# Note: clear the value if you wish to have the default touch text. ie: TOUCH_TEXT          = 

TOUCH_TEXT          = Teleport

# COLLISION - activate on bumping into the prim. great for an invisible prim in a dark tunnel 
# Notes: PHANTOM objects get locked to phantom state by the script to still detect avatars!
# Set Collision to 'No' and save to unlock Phantom, then disable phantom on the object. 
# You can now re-enable collision again to detect avatars bumping the solid object now.
# Note: format: 'Yes' or 'No'  Default: No

COLLISION              = No

# SIT_TEXT - Short txt displayed on the pie menu when right clicking the prim for sit
# Important: SIT ABILITY will *automatically activate* when an animation is present in inventory.
# Note: this feature is unused without an animation present in inventory.
# Note: clear the value if you wish to have the default sit text. ie: SIT_TEXT          = 
# Default value is empty and recommended with touch enabled and touch text set .

SIT_TEXT              = 

# FORCE_SIT - When an *animation is present*, we will force the user to sit on the object on touch
# Note: Useful when the animation makes more sense on some object like a ladder down a wishing well
# Note: in case of a general animation that can be played anywhere like a dance, you can disable.
# Note: this feature is unused without an animation present.
# Note: format: 'Yes' or 'No'
# Default is Yes


# MENU_TEXT - Menu text in the main menu. Default: Choose a destination:
MENU_TEXT       = Choose a destination:

FORCE_SIT           = Yes

# ANIM_OFFSET - a positional offset vector to adjust the animation position.
# Note: this setting is ONLY used when an animation  is present in inventory.
# Default (Fanatik's classic well 'ladder' animation) ANIM_OFFSET         = <0, 0.15, 0.95> 

ANIM_OFFSET         = <0, 0.15, 0.95>

# ANIM_ROTATION - a rotational vector to adjust the animation rotation
# Note: this setting is ONLY used when an animation  is present in inventory.
# Default (Fanatik's classic well 'ladder' animation) ANIM_ROTATION    = <0, 0, 90, 90> 

ANIM_ROTATION    = <0, 0, 90, 90> 

# SOUND_VOL - the volume of any sound played. valid ranges are 0.1 (low) to 1.0 (loudest)
# Note: this is only used when a sound is present in inventory.
# Note: Default: 1.0.

SOUND_VOL               = 1.0

# SOUND_RADIUS - limit sounds to this many meters around the teleporter. 0 means  unlimited.
# Note: this is only changed when a sound is present in inventory.
# Note: when no sound is present in inventory, the prim property radius is restored to unlimited.
# Note: Default unlimited. ie: SOUND_RADIUS        = 0

SOUND_RADIUS        = 0

# DELAY_TIME - the time to force delay before teleporting, even when using LM or the destination is chosen quicker.
# Note: this can be used to give any animation or sound present a decent chance to play. 
# Note: this feature can still be used when no sound or animations are present so turn off if undesired.
# Note: the teleporter nicely substracts any seconds the user spends choosing a destination. 
# Note: Recommended with animation or sound: 4.0
# Default 0.0

DELAY_TIME               = 4.0

# ALLOW_FOLLOW - traveling in pairs or in groups? its a nice to know where the other(s) went.
# Note: Enabling this enables the second person to use the teleporter within 30 seconds to follow the first person easily.
# Note: the destination will be revealed in the info text, and that next user gets a menu asking if they want to follow.
# Note: this does not force the user to follow, they can click no and get their own destinations menu.
# Note: after 30 seconds the teleporter clears and any new users get the normal destinations menu again.
# Available values are 'Yes' and 'No' default: Yes

ALLOW_FOLLOW       = Yes

# LM_LOOK_AT - a positional vector to be facing after teleporting using the single landmark inside.
# Note: this is only used when a landmark is inside, completely overruling the menu/destinations below.

LM_LOOK_AT           =  <83.46187, 137.83514, 2011.13098>

# DEBUG - For the developer to assist with debugging any potential future issues you might find..
# Note: debug will spam lots of extra developer information relevant to the internal functioning of the script. 
# Note: In case the script is acting out the creator may request you to enable this for more developer info. 
# Note: a special code will be given to you in case you're requested to turn this on.

DEBUG                       =

# Want more options? with a bit of scripting knowledge using the included API example script you can do anything you like .
# Want to trigger extra custom messages ? want to start and stop a particle effect ? offer inventory before they go ?
# An open (modifiable) API script is included with the system for scripters  that shows how to use the different events.
# The example script shows how to trigger particles. You could put the script in another *linked* prim to be the source..
# Look for the script called: '[SP] Smart Exp Multi Teleporter API example'

####################
# Note: To face a direction after teleporting, grab the position something you wish to face after teleporting and paste it behind your slurl.
# Note  the look at position is optional! (but it is one of the best features of our system. as unlike other systems, it actually works.)
# Note: you can have up to about ~50 destinations. the script will take care of its memory and not accept more when memory runs out.
# Note: there is a possibility to rewrite this and store way more slurls but i thought 50 should be plenty? if not, contact Night Starchild
# Note: the format is: name=slurl <lookat>
