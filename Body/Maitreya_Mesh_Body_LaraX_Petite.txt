Maitreya Mesh Body LaraX Petite

We listened to the requests of so many Lara mesh body users and the result is this improved, all new, NeXt Generation version of Lara: LaraX! A body with smoother weights and a rounder shape than ever before.

Alongside your new LaraX Petite (Full body or Add-on) body, you will also find the original Lara Petite (Full body or Add-on) body in your extras Unpacker HUD. This original Lara Petite (Full body or Add-on) is included for all content made previously, for the Lara mesh body Petite. 
Note that content made for the original Lara Petite body will not fit the LaraX Petite body and vice versa. Every mesh body requires it's own clothing, made especially for that body. You will will now have both bodies: LaraX Petite and the original Lara Petite, so you can switch between them effortlessly if you wish so.

Your Lara HUD Misc. tab will also bring you to the online documentation, if you touch HELP/INFO and then click on the link in the popup menu.

In addition to the online documentation, we are available in world to answer your questions (Contact: Gryphon Ronas) or use the Maitreya Lara Friends group chat.

Love,
Maitreya
